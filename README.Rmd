# String Manipulation in R

**Objectives**:

* 

```
- Start with vectors of strings, "inventory"
   - c("Red Apple", "Green Apple", "Ruby Red Grapefruit", "Queen Pineapple", "Red Spanish Pineapple")
- Compare to grep
- Graduate to the second dimension
- Compare to grep considering specific column placing or combined with awk
```

## Software Installation

### Two options to move forward:

#### 1. Installing R language and RStudio IDE

R language and RStudio installed locally in your development environment: [Instructions from RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

#### 2. Using a web-based R environment (you cannot save your work)

Navigate to **Interactive In-Browser R by DataCamp Light** at: [https://learn.athitkao.com/computer.html](https://learn.athitkao.com/computer.html)

## Background

* The typical data you will work on in R are structured tabular data; think of an Excel spreadsheet of neat rows and columns of cells 
* In R, you can easily manipulate specific rows and/or columns of your tabular data, even specific cells!
* Before we begin, let's understand how to navigate tabular data in R
* Let's make a tabular `data.frame` object with two columns of information about people's favorite foods:

```{r}
df = data.frame(
  "name" = c("Tina", "Gene", "Louise"),
  "food" = c("Buns", "Burgers", "")
)
print(df)
```

* We will concentrate on only manipulating tabular data by columns in this tutorial; this is because most tabular data are structured in that rows are records of data and the columns are values of the same type (e.g.)
